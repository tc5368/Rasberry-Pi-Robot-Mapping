# Rasberry-Pi-Robot-Mapping
Using a raspberry pi 3 to move a robot around a room, the robot is controlled by a arduino combined with a robot shield. The information between the pi and the arduino is sent by the serial module. I am currently implementing a qr code reader so the robot can function without me needing to put a keyboard into it to start it.
